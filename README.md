The project was developed as a thesis, due of a big interest to the 3D graphics.
For now, it has a version of v1.0 and the next one I'm planning to develop in the future. 

I use such technologies like: 
- Gulp;
- React with Redux;
- trying CSS with SASS (for now variables only);
- a bit (a little bit) of Node and Express;
- Mongo DB with Mongoose
- ThreeJS to display models
- ThreeJS converter to convert .OBJ format of models into .js (json);
